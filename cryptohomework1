Problem 1: Suppose we are told that the Vigenere ciphertext CCWEKHBSJIR decrypts to
CHICKENSOUP. Determine the cipher key.

According to the rules of Vigenere cipher:
                                    C = P + K mod 26
Plaintext:  CHICKENSOUP
ciphertext: CCWEKHBSJIR

so the cipher key is: 0 21 14 2 0 3 14 0 21 14 2
which is : AVOCADOAVOC

Problem 2:The following ciphertext has been encrypted using the Permutation Cipher.

Find the permutation key and describe what techniques you used.

Let's assume the cipher block is 5:
WE can see in the last block: BAYME , The word can be rearranged to MAYBE, whose permutation key is 42315.
Then apply this key to all blocks:
HESWA   WE SHA
OLGLO   LL GO O

Now we get the plaintext:

WE SHALL FIGHT WITH GROWING CONFIDENCE AND GROWING STRENGTH IN THE AIR
WE SHALL DEFEND OUR ISLAND WHATEVER THE COST MAYBE

Problem 3: Answer the following questions:
1. Describe (in your own words) what the Index of Coincidence is.
2. What is the IoC value for uniformly random text, assuming a standard 26-letter alphabet. Explain why.
